# Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  
This project demonstrates:
- Text normalization  
- Tokenization  
- Stopword removal  
- Stemming and lemmatization  
- A case study using the IMDB movie reviews dataset
